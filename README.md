# Scent-Arts-E-commerce-Website
The Scent-Arts e-commerce website is a platform dedicated to selling a wide range of fragrance products and is designed to provide an elegant, immersive shopping experience. For manual testing, the websiteâ€™s features, navigation, and user-focused elements must be validated to ensure robust performance and ease of use.

Manual Testing Focuses,

Usability Testing: Verify clear navigation, readable design elements, and intuitive product search and filtering for all user types.
Functionality Testing: Test major workflows such as account creation, item add/remove from cart, discount code application, and order placement.
Payment Testing: Confirm every payment mode is operational, error messages display correctly, and confirmation receipts are generated.
Accessibility Compliance: Check adherence to accessibility standards, including screen reader compatibility, keyboard navigation, and alternative text for images.
Performance Testing: Monitor load times, responsiveness, and cross-browser/device compatibility for all interactive features.
Security Testing: Assess login workflows, payment gateway protection, and data privacy settings.

Manual Testing Expected Results:
1.Homepage loads quickly and all main navigation links work.
2.Product images, details, and scent descriptions are visible and accurate.
3.Registration, login, and password recovery work for new/existing accounts.
4.Shopping cart reflects additions/removals live and calculates totals correctly.
